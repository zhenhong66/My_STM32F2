This is an RL-USB-Host and RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files from the Mass Storage 
Device and format the device. 

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL   =  25 MHz
   - CPUCLK = 120 MHz
   - USBCLK =  48 MHz

 - Communication Interface Settings:
   - USART3: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

The MSD_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

MCBSTM32F200: Standalone application for Keil MCBSTM32F200 Board using
              OTG_FS and OTG_HS as USB Ports and COM port as a communication interface.

           Connect a serial cable to RS232 port using
           HyperTerminal at 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity,
           1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.

Notes:   - Cable necessary for connecting USB memory device should have 
           USB micro-A plug connector on one side and Standard USB Type-A 
           receptacle connector on the other side.
           Set jumpers J13 and J14 to 1-2 position, to select UART3.
